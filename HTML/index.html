				<h3>Speech and Language Virtual Therapy</h3>
				<ul>
					<li class="li">
						<u>Speech and language virtual therapy</u> is an innovative approach that uses technology to provide speech and language therapy 
						services remotely. This form of therapy is conducted through <u>video conferencing platforms,</u> allowing 
						therapists and clients to interact in real-time from different locations. 
						In a typical session, the therapist uses a <u>computer, tablet, or smartphone</u> to 
						connect with the client. The virtual setting offers a range of interactive tools and activities, 
						such as <u>digital flashcards, games, and worksheets,</u> which can be shared on the screen to make 
						the sessions engaging and effective.</li>

				<h3>Massage Therapy</h3>
				<ul>
					<li class="li">
						Massage therapy involves various techniques to 
						manipulate the muscles and other soft tissues of the body. Unlike acupressure, 
						which focuses on specific points, massage therapy often involves broader, 
						more generalized strokes. Types of massage therapy we offer are <b>Swedish Massage</b>, <b>Hot Stone Massage</b>,
						<b><u>Thai Massage</u></b> and <b>Trigger Point Massage.</b>
						It helps <u>reduce stress, anxiety, muscle tension and pain</u> making it effective for 
						managing conditions such as chronic back pain, arthritis, and fibromyalgia. By improving blood 
						circulation, massage therapy promotes faster healing of injured tissues and reduces inflammation.</li>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)" style="background-color: green; color: white;">How do you get started with virtual therapy sessions?<span class="arrow"></span></div>
            <div class="faq-answer" style="background-color: rgba(143, 167, 10, 0.863); color: white;">To get started with virtual therapy sessions, you typically need to sign up on our website and 
				complete an initial assessment form. After that, you will be matched with a licensed therapist or 
				rehabilitation specialist who will schedule your first session. You'll need a device with a 
				camera and microphone, as well as a stable internet connection for the sessions.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)" style="background-color: green; color: white;">Are virtual therapy sessions as effective as in-person sessions?<span class="arrow"></span></div>
            <div class="faq-answer" style="background-color: rgba(143, 167, 10, 0.863); color: white;">Yes, virtual therapy sessions can be just as effective as in-person sessions 
				for many individuals and conditions. Research has shown that telehealth services can lead to comparable outcomes in terms of patient satisfaction, 
				adherence to treatment plans, and overall effectiveness. However, the suitability of virtual therapy can depend on the specific needs and conditions of the patient.</div>

		<div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)" style="background-color: green; color: white;">What role does the patient play in their own rehabilitation?<span class="arrow"></span></div>
            <div class="faq-answer" style="background-color: rgba(143, 167, 10, 0.863); color: white;">Patients play a crucial role in their rehabilitation by actively 
				participating in therapy sessions, following the prescribed treatment plan, performing exercises at home, and providing feedback on their progress. 
				Your engagement and adherence to the plan significantly impact the effectiveness of the therapy.</div>
        </div>

            <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)" style="background-color: green; color: white;">Can therapy help with post-surgical recovery?<span class="arrow"></span></div>

				recovery. We provide tailored rehabilitation programs to support healing, restore function, and help you return to your normal 
				activities as quickly and safely as possible.
